    <h1>Spyfall</h1>
    <p>
        Spyfall is a party game in which players take on the roles of secret agents trying to identify a spy among their ranks. 
        Each round, players are dealt location cards that indicate where they are (e.g. "on a cruise ship," "at a casino"). 
        One player is secretly designated as the spy and does not receive a location card. 
        The other players ask each other questions in an attempt to figure out who the spy is, while the spy tries to blend in and avoid detection. 
        The game ends when either the spy is correctly identified or the round time runs out.
