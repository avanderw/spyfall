            Spyfall is a social deduction card game where players try to figure out who among them is the spy.
            Spyfall can be a good game for a party, as it is designed to be played with a large group of people and
            has a social, interactive element that encourages players to engage with each other. The game's
            fast-paced, unpredictable nature and the pressure to bluff and think on your feet can make for an
            exciting and entertaining experience.

        <h2>How to play?</h2>
        <p>
            In Spyfall, players are randomly assigned a role, either a spy or a member of a location. The game takes
            place over a series of rounds, and at the start of each round, all players receive a card showing the
            same location, except for the spy, who receives a card reading "Spy."
        </p>
        <p>
            Players then take turns asking each other questions, trying to gather information about their roles and
            determine who among them is the spy. The spy must do their best to blend in and avoid giving themselves
            away, while the other players try to identify the spy. The round ends when either the spy is
            successfully caught, or a certain amount of time has passed.
