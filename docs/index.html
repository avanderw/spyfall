            Spyfall is a party game in which players take on the roles of secret agents trying to identify a spy among
            their
            ranks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each round, players are dealt location cards that indicate where they are (e.g. "on a cruise ship," "at a
            casino").
            One player is secretly designated as the spy and does not receive a location card.
            The other players ask each other questions in an attempt to figure out who the spy is, while the spy tries
            to
            blend in and avoid detection.
        </p>
        <p>
            The game ends when either the spy is correctly identified or the round time runs out.
